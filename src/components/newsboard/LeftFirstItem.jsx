                        Cities have stopped being the engines of growth and

                    The pandemic is dealing prodigious blows to cities across
                    the country. But the world can’t hope to thrive again if its
                    cities don’t—they’re the places that have historically
                    supplied the keys for unlocking human potential. Though
                    beset by racism and other injustices, cities not only
                    provided shared, robust public infrastructure like schools,
                    libraries and transit systems, they stirred together vast
                    numbers of people from different cultures and classes.
